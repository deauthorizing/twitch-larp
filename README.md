# twitch-larp

A horribly coded userscript to LARP your username and followers on [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) - made by wish and fusi.

# ⚠️ Bugs

WE WILL NOT BE FIXING OR PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THIS, DO NOT DM ANY OF US.

## 🌀 What It Does

- Larps username everywhere on Twitch. only the profile page, sidebar and settings this time.
- Larps followers count and verified checkmark.
- Larps title bar, so it'd display your fake display name and your fake @handle.

## 🛠 Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
2. Add the script manually, there's a tutorial video in the Telegram if you don't know how to.
3. Visit `twitch.tv`
4. Press Shift+S to bring up the GUI, tick the boxes on the things you wanna spoof.
5. Depending on the options you checked, there will be textboxes so you can put your real values and fake values in. 
6. Click Save, then exit and use Shift+U to toggle off and on.
